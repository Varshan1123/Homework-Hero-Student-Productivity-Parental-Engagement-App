## 🎯 Overview

**Homework Hero** is a no-code education app designed to help students stay productive by tracking homework, submitting assignments, and earning playtime rewards with parental approval.

Built using Glide, the app connects **students**, **parents**, and **teachers** to create accountability, motivation, and communication around daily learning tasks.

This project was developed end-to-end as part of a **Product Management learning journey**, applying real-world PM frameworks and techniques — from user research to MVP launch.

### 🌟 Why Homework Hero?

- **For Students:** Stay organized, track homework, and earn rewards
- **For Parents:** Monitor progress and approve playtime rewards
- **For Teachers:** Assign homework and track submissions effortlessly

##  🔍 Problem Statement
Students often struggle to complete homework consistently due to lack of structure, motivation, and real-time feedback. Parents have limited visibility into their child’s progress, and teachers find it difficult to track submissions across multiple students. This results in missed deadlines, lower engagement, and poor accountability. <br>
Homework Hero bridges this gap by providing:<br>
- ✅ Enabling teachers to assign and monitor homework.<br>
- ✅ A centralized dashboard for students to view and submit homework.<br>
- ✅ Notifications for parents once all homework is done.<br>
- ✅ A reward-based motivation system that reinforces positive study habits.<br>

## 📊 Market Size Analysis

### Market Segments
We analyzed school-age students, parents, and schools as potential market participants, with both global and India-focused calculations.

### Market Size Calculations

#### TAM — Total Addressable Market
Everyone who could theoretically use this type of product worldwide.

- **Student Population:** ~1.5 billion students globally in K–12 (UNESCO data)
- **Pricing Model:** $2 per user/month subscription or in-app monetization
- **Calculation:** 1.5B students × $2 × 12 months = **$36 billion annually**
- **TAM ≈ $36B globally**

#### SAM — Serviceable Available Market
Target market: Urban, tech-connected families in India initially.

- **Total Students:** ~100 million students in India's urban and semi-urban K–12 education system
- **Smartphone Penetration:** ~70% (approximately 70M potential users)
- **Realistic Reach:** 30% adoption potential → 21M users
- **Calculation:** 21M × $2 × 12 months = **$504 million annually**
- **SAM ≈ $500M (India-focused)**

#### SOM — Serviceable Obtainable Market
Realistic short-term market capture goal.

- **Target Capture:** 1% of SAM in India
- **Calculation:** 1% × $500M = **$5 million annual potential revenue**
- **SOM ≈ $5M (short-term realistic goal)**

### Takeaway:
The TAM-SAM-SOM framework demonstrates strong scalability potential. The app starts in a niche market (India's student productivity segment) but operates within a multi-billion dollar global opportunity, with clear pathways for expansion.
